### Installation

Make sure you have **NodeJS** version **8.10.0** or greater.

Use [create-resolve-app](packages/core/create-resolve-app) package to create a new reSolve application. The easiest way is to use [npx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx/v/1.1.1) ()

```sh
npx create-resolve-app my-awesome-app
cd my-awesome-app
npm run dev
```

The created application is accessible using the http://localhost:3000/ and `http://<your_ip>:3000/` URLs (you can [change the URL settings](https://github.com/reimagined/resolve/blob/master/docs/API%20References.md)). Start learning **reSolve** with the [**ToDo List App Tutorial**](https://github.com/reimagined/resolve/blob/master/docs/Tutorials/ToDo%20List%20App%20Tutorial.md) tutorial. Use the [**documentation**](#documentation), [**tutorials**](#tutorials) and [**examples**](#examples) to learn **reSolve** more deeply.

Instead of npx you can also use npm or yarn tools:

- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

  > Note: Installing a package globally may require administrative privileges. That means you have to use the `sudo` prefix on Linux and MacOS, or start a terminal with the administrative privileges on Windows.

  ```sh
  npm i -g create-resolve-app
  create-resolve-app my-awesome-app
  cd my-awesome-app
  npm run dev
  ```

- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/)

  ```sh
  yarn create resolve-app my-awesome-app
  cd my-awesome-app
  yarn run dev
  ```

  yarn create resolve-app nested-list-example -e nested-list
  ```

  ```sh
  npm i -g create-resolve-app
  create-resolve-app nested-list-example -e nested-list
  ```

## <a name="documentation">**ðŸ“š Documentation**</a>
